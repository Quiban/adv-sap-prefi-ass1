## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- SOA is a design paradigm and architectural style that organizes software systems as a collection of loosely connected, interoperable services.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Loose Coupling: SOA services are intended to be self-contained entities with little dependencies on other services. This enables changes to one service without affecting others.
- Interoperability: SOA fosters interoperability through the use of standardized communication protocols and data formats, allowing services to communicate effortlessly across platforms and technologies.
3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices is a software development architectural style and strategy that builds an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each microservice is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be independently built, deployed, and scaled. 
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- Microservices have the advantage of allowing different components of an application to be scaled separately. This means that resources can be allocated depending on the unique requirements of each microservice, resulting in increased efficiency and performance.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- Microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are architectural paradigms that strive to construct modular, scalable, and adaptable software systems. They have some commonalities, but they also have significant distinctions.
